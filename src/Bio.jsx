                Growing up in a family of photographers, I was fascinated by the idea of making someone have a sense of emotion when seeing photos.

            <h2 className='bio'>
                Therefore, I always strived to look to improve my photography and my framing skills, and with that, creating catalogue of my progress has always been an interest of mine.
